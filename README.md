🦠 COVID-19 Prediction Using Machine Learning
This project uses supervised machine learning techniques to predict whether a person is likely to be infected with COVID-19 based on their symptoms and other health-related features.
🧠 Model Overview
Model Type: Logistic Regression (can be extended to other ML classifiers)

Goal: Predict COVID-19 status (infected or not) based on symptom data.

Dataset: Symptom-based dataset with features like Fever, Cough, Tiredness, etc.

📦 Libraries Used
pandas

numpy

matplotlib

seaborn

sklearn (for model building and evaluation)

✅ Output
Accuracy and confusion matrix

Model performance metrics

Example predictions based on user input

📌 Future Improvements
Add more sophisticated models (RandomForest, XGBoost)

Integrate symptom checker UI using Flask

Deploy as a web app

Improve dataset quality and diversity
